--> "My name is Gabriel Francimat and I'm studying at the UNIFOR university in Fortaleza, CearÃ¡ and I became a programmer,
    mainly, out of curiosity to understand how the different languages work and
    in which they are used and for having a great desire to learn them in addition to producing programs that
    benefit people and facilitate their actions. About my programming knowledge I have a
    great base in js (JavaScript), in Java I know the basics of object-oriented programming, in addition to python,
    html and css which I already did some web development projects in college."
